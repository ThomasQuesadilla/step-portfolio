    <h3> Who Am I? </h3>
    <p> My name is Thomas Quintanilla. I'm a rising junior at Duke Univeristy and a current STEP intern at Google. 
      I come from a family of immigrants who moved from Colombia to Elizabeth, New Jersey in 1999. 
      I was born in the city of Edison, and 5 years after moved to Pembroke Pines, Florida, which I now claim as my home. 
      In fact, I sometimes forget I was born in New Jersey and not Florida.

    <p> 
      I have a love-hate relationship of photography. 
      I hate photos taken of me, unless it's with friends or capturing a special moment, and I especially hate family photos (except that one specific photo with all of my cousins). 
      But taking photos is a hobby I've considered picking up for a long time, since I enjoy being the one behind the camera.
      This world is filled with beautiful things, and I feel like without photography, we wouldn't truly see what the world has to offer.
      Natural landscapes, abstract stills, and candid shots are just a few of the many things I love photographing.
